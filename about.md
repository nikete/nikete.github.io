Currently, I mostly think about what shape institutions for global co-creation of knowledge should take. I am always very happy to hear from potential collaborators, specially those with very different skillsets. Im most actively working on market structure for the permissionless collaborative use and fine tunning of large language models.

I go by nikete in everything but the most formal of documents.


Broadly, I am motivated to work towards [the improvement of the understanding](http://bactra.org/Spinoza/TIE/). Designing, building and understanding the computational engines that mediate collective cognition. Methodologically my tools come mostly from economics and machine learning. I enjoy theory-driven work and opportunistic experimentation. I care about hw can we design better ways of eliciting which are the best deicisions that can be taken. Beyond the ICU, I have also studied and helped in building various markets and  related institutions accross a wide variety of domains (social media, pharmaceuticals, betting, advertising, music royalties, MEV).


I have co-authored paper in machine learning conferences (NIPS, WWW, UAI, IJCAI) and  medical journals (Critical Care Medicine, Chest, Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine). Google scholar has a [good first approximation of my output.](https://scholar.google.it/citations?hl=en&user=_2Z3DcoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). My [PhD thesis](https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/262297) was on algorithm and mechanism design for aiding decision making while preserving the freedom of choice of the subject of those decisions.
