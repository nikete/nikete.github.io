Currently, I work at [GroupLang](https://grouplang.com/). We study how LLMs interacting with groups impact incentives. We are hiring and are remote-first.


I go by nikete in everything but the most formal of documents. Active on [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/nikete).


Broadly, I am motivated to work towards [the improvement of understanding](http://bactra.org/Spinoza/TIE/). I design, build, and study the computational engines that mediate collective cognition. Methodologically, my tools come mostly from economics and machine learning. I enjoy theory-driven work and opportunistic experimentation. I care about how we can better elicit what the best decisions are. I have studied and helped build and run various markets and related institutions across a wide variety of domains (social media, pharmaceuticals, betting, advertising, music royalties, MEV). I have also done work on improving observational understanding of decision making in non-market settings, most intensely in hospital ICUs.


I have co-authored papers at machine learning conferences (NeurIPS, WWW, UAI, IJCAI) and in medical journals (Critical Care Medicine, Chest, Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine). Google Scholar has a [good first approximation of my output](https://scholar.google.it/citations?hl=en&user=_2Z3DcoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). My [PhD thesis](https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/262297) was on algorithm and mechanism design for aiding decision making while preserving the freedom of choice of the decision subject.
