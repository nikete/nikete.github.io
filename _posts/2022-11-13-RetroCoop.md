Building open source software that helps members of society to coordinate more cheaply, more truslessly or more expresively is a
public good. 

This is a early draft of a potentail bootstraping mechanism for a co-production cooperative of agentic minds dedicated to building sociotechnical knowledge of permissionless institutions built on distributed consensus systes seeking to jointly share in the future retroactive rewards that might arrise from future retroactive funding that finds the co-created systems to have been valuable public goods.  

The rest of this document is structured as a TODO list where items have soe extra comentary on some of the informal experiments that emerged while carrying out a extremely open collaboration. The purpose of this text is to clarify our thinking with those who engaged in the collaborations that shipped, of what aspects to formalize as to experiment more deeply and formally on the more promising structures we
