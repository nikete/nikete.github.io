title: Adjusting Ethereum Gas Costs

Currently the gas cost of different operations is fixed in the code of the clients.

[the current relative gas prices list is basically fixed](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/params/protocol_params.go)

Given some definition of utility of the network then adjusting relative prices via SGD to maximize the realized utility of the network. 

Alternatively coudl abandon per-op pricing and allow submiters to say how much gas to pay.

A naive measure of utility of the network could be the value of the fees being paid.
This seems ineficient from a welfare perspective since it would encourage monopolistic pricing of the resources.
How can we track something closer to the total surplus? Using randomization to estimate elasticities?
