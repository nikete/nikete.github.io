title: Adjusting Ethereum Gas Costs

Currently the gas cost of different operations is fixed in the code of the clients.

Given some definition of utility of the network then adjusting relative prices via SGD to maximize the realized utility of the network. 

A naive measure of utility of the network could be the value of the fees being paid.
This seems ineficient from a welfare perspective since it would encourage monopolistic pricing of the resources.
How can we track something closer to the total surplus? Using randomization to estimate elasticities?
