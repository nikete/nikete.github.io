Prompt engineering can be loosely thought of as providing the context that shapes the interface between a model and the task.
Prompt engineering may be a transient phenomenon a la "advanced/cyborg/centaur" chess.
A market structure for improvements to the interface between models and the world is still generically valuable.

How to compose prompts? Are the useful meta prompts? How stable are prompts accross models? what does that correlate to?
