# Running notes: market structures for prompt engineering services

attention conservation notice: incredibly rough scratchpad of ideas

Prompt engineering can be loosely thought of as providing the context that shapes the interface between a model and the task.
Prompt engineering may be a transient phenomenon a la "advanced/cyborg/centaur" chess.
A market structure for improvements to the interface between models and the world is still generically valuable, even if human crafted prompts dissapear.

How to compose prompts? Are the useful meta prompts? How stable are prompts accross models? what does that correlate to?

What market structures are expressive enough? can be understood? can be incnetive compatible?
