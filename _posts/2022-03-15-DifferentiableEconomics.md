One of the most exciting lines of work for me is towards automating mechanism design, sprouting from http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/duetting19a.html
https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=5937791241364902632&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en&scioq=regretnet , there was recently a super compeling talk by David Parkes on this line of work

I am very keen in bringing this to the attention of the ethereum and those exploring novel public good funding mechanisms.
Those interested in exploring potential field experiments that can take place, where the computational contract (most likely solidity on the EVM) learns the incentives it can provide to maximize notions of social welfare (so for example as in 
https://econcs.seas.harvard.edu/files/econcs/files/golowich_ijcai18.pdf which use it to design strategy-proof, multi-facility mechanisms that minimize expected social cost).
