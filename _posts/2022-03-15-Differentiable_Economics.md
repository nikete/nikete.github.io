One of the most exciting lines of work for me is towards [automating mechanism design via deep learning](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/duetting19a.html), [sprouting from this](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=5937791241364902632&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en&scioq=regretnet). There is a very compeling talk by David Parkes on this line of work:

A blog post describing [a GAN based approach](https://iclr-blog-track.github.io/2022/03/25/two-player-auction-learning/).

I am very keen in bringing this to the attention of the ethereum and those exploring novel public good funding mechanisms.
Those interested in exploring potential field experiments that can take place, where the computational contract (most likely solidity on zkEVM) learns the incentives it can provide to maximize notions of social welfare. Using regret minimization for aproximately truthful mechanism design was used in 
 [the use it to design strategy-proof, multi-facility mechanisms that minimize expected social cost](https://econcs.seas.harvard.edu/files/econcs/files/golowich_ijcai18.pdf).
