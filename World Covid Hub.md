title:  hcov19 and a worldwide hub for open forecasting research.

Following up on the Covid19 ForecastHub, recently there is a European hub, this note is to find collaborators for a worldwide hub.  The idea is to work as a opean research organization.

It is very hard to know how to compare and evaluate forecasting models that are made after the fact. There is value in open research in model forecasts. 

Building  on  Our World in Data Covid19 dataset, and the GISAID hcov19 variant  https://www.gisaid.org/hcov19-variants/ .


Some longer term extensions that I think would be particularly interesting woudl be: conditional forecasts, in particular conditioning on the RNA sequence of the dominant variant in different countries seems eminently useful.
